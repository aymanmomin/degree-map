This is all of the stuff i've had in my repo so far

-Data is straighforward, just all of the
 data to be seeded for the db

-Models are what dictate how each table is gonna be formed, 
the index file specifically dictate relationships between them

-routes are what will allow front end back end communication, 
along with server.js

-seeders are what will fill tables with data from data files

this is just my personal workspace stuff so im not sure about how package.json and the other auto generated stuff will behave with what you guys already have.
